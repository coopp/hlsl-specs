## Introduction

An effort is underway to modernize compilation of HLSL based shaders by adding
HLSL compilation to clang. This document is a sub proposal for 
[0016](../0016-c-interface-compiler-library.md) to break down the work
required to achieve the first milestone of adopotion by the ML team and
ability to compile a compute shader using clang as a library.

The Issues created here will be ordered to help contruct a roadmap that can be
leveraged towards defining a realistic timeline to completion.
